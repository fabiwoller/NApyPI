# NApyPI: Efficient statistics in Python for large-scale heterogeneous data with enhanced support for missing data

A python packaged version of our software NApy. This offers a fast python tool providing statistical tests and effect sizes for a more comprehensive and informative analysis of mixed type data in the presence of missingness. Written both in C++ and numba and parallelized with OpenMP.



# Installation
